# I- What is SURFMAP?
In a nutshell, SURFMAP is a small software designed to compute the surface properties of a protein, and to map this criterion on a 2-D plan through a sinusoidal projection. It enables thus the rapid visualization of a surface propertie across the whole surface of a protein. Such view can prove to be very useful when comparing the surface properties of homologous proteins for example.

# II- A basic overview

## Surface properties mapped by SURFMAP

The properties that SURFMAP is mapping must be chosen among:  

- stickiness (1): measure of the propensity of an amino acid to be enriched (or depleted) at protein binding sites. The stickiness enables to detect regions that are theoretically more prone to interaction, i.e. "more sticky", from other regions.

- Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity  (2): measure of the degree of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of amino acids according to the Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale. 

- Wimley–White hydrophobicity (3): measure of the degree of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of amino acids according to the Wimley–White hydrophobicity scale. 

- circular variance (4): this measure characterizes the geometric properties of molecular structures by distinguishing between atoms accessible to the surface and buried atoms. In our case it is useful for the mapping of geometrical properties of the protein surface such as invaginations and protuberant regions.

- electrostatic potential: SURFMAP can call the APBS software (5) that will compute the electrostatic potential, using the CHARMM forcefield (6), and map the resulting potential on a 2-D map.

- b-factor: the user also have the possibility to map any value contained in the b-factor of the pdb structure provided in input.  

- binding_sites: this option is similar to the b-factor option, but use a discrete set of colors, instead of a continuous one. When using this option, please provide a pdb file with discrete values in b-factor.

## Basic functioning of SURFMAP

SURFMAP needs in input a pdb file. To use SURFMAP you need to execute the script SURFMAP_launcher.py. This script serves as a pipeline and will launch successively all the necessary scripts.  

In the directory example there is several files (a pdb file, and 2 coordinates mapping file) to familiarise yourself with SURFMAP.

Basically there are two mandatory arguments: the input pdb file, and the surface property you want to map. All the rest is optional.  
<br>

## Warnings

- SURFMAP does not take into account heteroatoms (HETATM). Please be careful that your pdb file does not contain special residues, such as selenocystein for example. The hydrophobicity and stickiness scales were not designed to take into account these special residues.

- The different protonation states of the HIS amino acid are considered the same as HIS.

- The first step of the cartography involves a call to MSMS (7). So you need to give in input a file that can be handled by MSMS.

# III- List of arguments of SURFMAP_launcher.py

SURFMAP_launcher.py can take the following arguments:  
<br>

###-pdb  
input file. The input file need to be in pdb format (**MANDATORY**)  
<br>

###-tomap
surface propertie of the protein to map
There are the following possibilities: stickiness, Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity, Wimley-White hydrophobicity, electrostatics potential, circular variance or any value in the bfactor of the input pdb file. If the user chose the option "all"  (**MANDATORY**)  
<br>

###-rad
radius of the atoms used to create the shell. Default value is 3.0Å, normally you do not have to choose another radius. (**OPTIONAL**)  
<br>

###-d
name of the output directory. By default a directory “output_SURFMAP_INPUTPDB_PROPERTY” is created in the current directory (for example output_SURFMAP_1g3n_A_stickiness/) (**OPTIONAL**)  
<br>

###-s
size of a grid cell (in degrees). Default value is 5, which results in a 72 (360/5) x 36 (180/5) grid map. Value must be congruent with 180 (180%%value = 0), otherwise SURFMAP will raise an error message (**OPTIONAL**)  
<br>

###-res
to map the coordinates of residues on the 2-D map (**OPTIONAL**).  
Format is the following: CHAIN RESNB RES  
With CHAIN the chain index in the input pdb, RESNB the residue numer in the input pdb, and RES the residue type.  
Important: residue numbers must correspond to the numbering in the input pdb file   
<br>

###--coords
map a set of coordinates on the resulting map (**OPTIONAL**) 
<br>

###--nosmooth
With this option the smoothing step is skipped (By default output maps are smoothed).   (**OPTIONAL**)  
<br>

###--png
option to generate a png file. By default SURFMAP generates a pdf file. (**OPTIONAL**)  
<br>

###--keep
option to keep all intermediary files. By default SURFMAP keeps only a pdf + txt file of the smoothed matrix. (**OPTIONAL**)  
<br>

# IV- List of scripts

## main directory  
**- SURFMAP_launcher.py**   
Launcher script for SURFMAP. Type "python SURFMAP_launcher.py -h" to see all the arguments. This is this script that will execute all the other SURFMAP's scripts.  
<br>

## directory "scripts"  
<br />
**- computeCoordList.R** 
<br /> 
computes coord_list files from partlist.out files

a coord_list file is is a 6 columns file listing, for each cell grid of the map, all the residues included. the format is the following:

| phi | theta | score | resnb | restype | index_sol

with:  
-phi: abscissa coordinate on the map  
-theta: odinate coordinate on the map  
-score: score of the property tested  
-resnb: residue number in the input pdb  
-restype: residue type  
-index_sol: index of the generated particle  
<br>

**- computeMaps.R**  
script that computes a pdf map from a smoothed matrix file  
<br>

**- computeMatrices.R**  
<br>
script that computes a smoothed matrix from a coordlist file. The format is the following:

| phi | theta | value

with:  
-phi: abscissa coordinate on the map  
-theta: ordinate coordinate on the map  
-value: the value of the property tested. A value of 100 means that the grid cell is outside the projection. A value of 'NA' means that there is no particles in the grid cell.  
<br>

**- compute_shell.sh**  
This script is mainly use to call MSMS to compute the solvent excluded surface of the protein, from which the "shell" (i.e. the point-particles at the surface of the protein) is derived. It also calls APBS to compute electrostatic potential if the user requests to map electrostatic potential.  
<br>

**- multival_csv_to_pdb.py**   
script used specifically for electrostatics calculation. It simply modifies the format of the output file of the APBS executable "multivalue".  
<br>
  
## directory "tools"  
  
**- Structure.py**  
Contains a set functions used by SURFMAP  
<br>
  
**- SurfmapTools.py**  
script that associate the closest residues to each particles. compute all the surface properties values.
